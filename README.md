# Geeks UI - Bootstrap Theme Recreation

## Overview

This project is built for a personal learning purposes. I am here recreating a Boostrap theme - [Geeks UI](https://geeksui.codescandy.com/index.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawEmsvlleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHei2utnh7a71sRMc_ahcDLCNX0t2_ArFqL0D0kvCWY9PCoOgVaD5jvAH6g_aem_kdlKv0XCUPLIevjN1pK0hA) - from **Codescandy** in order to improve my front-end development skills. The goal is to replicate the theme's design and functionality as closely as possible with usage of **HTML**, **SASS**, **JavaScript**, followed by **BEM** methodology and **Progressive Enhancement** principles.

## Purpose

I am building this project to:
* Deepen my understanding of HTML, SASS, JavaScript, BEM and Progressive Enhancement
* Practice recreating professional designs
* Learn effective code structure and organization

## Attribution

The original theme design and asssets are created by **Codescandy**. I do not claim any ownership of the original design or assets. This project is solely for educational purposes, not intended for commercial use. All credit for the original design and functionality goes to **Codescandy**.
